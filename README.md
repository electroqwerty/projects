# My Projects

Welcome to my projects repository! This repository serves as a central hub for my various data science and machine learning projects. Below, you'll find a list of my projects with brief descriptions and links to their respective repositories.

## Project List

### 1. [Loan Default Prediction - Gradient Boosted Models](https://github.com/electroqwerty/projects-loan_defaults_prediction)

This project focuses on predicting loan defaults using advanced feature selection techniques and model tuning. The primary dataset used is `applications_train.csv`, and the main goal is to build models that perform well in terms of F1 score, F2 score, and ROC-AUC.

**Key Aspects:**
- Comprehensive feature analysis using SHAP, BORUTA, and RFECV.
- Model development with XGBoost and CatBoost.
- Extensive hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

### 2. [Toxic Comment Classification - NLP DL](https://github.com/electroqwerty/projects-NLP_toxic_comments)

The objective of this project was to classify almost 160,000 comments into six labels of toxicity. The goal was to develop a model capable of predicting hateful comments on online platforms.

**Key Aspects:**
- Utilized DistilBERT-cased for classification.
- Explored and visualized the dataset in-depth.
- Developed and evaluated models with detailed metrics and visualizations.

### 3. [Multitask Learning Model on UTKFaces Dataset - DL Computer Vision](https://github.com/electroqwerty/projects-dl_age_gender_prediction)

This project involved creating a multitask learning model trained on the UTKFaces dataset to predict the age and gender of individuals in photographs. The dataset comprised over 23,000 images.

**Key Aspects:**
- Combined binary classification for gender and regression for age.
- Implemented data curation and removal of outliers.
- Developed models using ResNet18 and evaluated performance.



### 4. [Soccer Match Outcome Prediction](https://github.com/electroqwerty/projects-socker_prediction_project)

This project aimed to predict soccer match outcomes using various approaches. It involved aggregating team-specific features, assessing multicollinearity, and finalizing feature selection to build predictive models.

**Key Aspects:**
- Built logistic regression and random forest models.
- Conducted multicollinearity analysis using VIF and correlation.
- Performed extensive feature engineering and statistical tests.
- Visualized data aspects and performed EDA.
